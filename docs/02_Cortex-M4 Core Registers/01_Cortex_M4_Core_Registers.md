# Cortex-M4 Core Registers

## Why do we need registers?

Let's start with the most basic reason.
Suppose, when we write as :

```c
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
int c = a + b;
```

At runtime, a and b ultimately exist somewhere in memory. But the CPU's arithmetic hardware works with values held in its registers.

Conceptually :

```text
RAM
       │
       │ load a
       ▼
      R0
      10

RAM
       │
       │ load b
       ▼
      R1
      20

       │
       │ CPU adds
       ▼

      R2
      30
      
R0 = 10
R1 = 20

R2 = R0 + R1
```
**Registers provide very fast storage directly inside the CPU for values the CPU is actively working with.**

## Cortex-M4 Core Registers

The ARM Cortex-M4 processor inside STM32F407VG has registers divided into groups.

Cortex-M4 Core Registers

```text

|
|-- General Purpose Registers (R0 - R12)
|
|-- Special Registers
|
|-- Program Status Registers
|
|-- Control Registers
|
|-- Floating Point Registers (optional)
```



## 1. General Purpose Registers (R0-R12):

There are 13 general-purpose registers: R0 - R12. **Are R0–R12 identical?** At the hardware level, they are all 32-bit registers. But the ARM procedure-call convention gives different registers different typical roles. 

**R0-R3 (Argument / Return Registers):**

These have special roles according to ARM calling convention.

Example:
```text
R0-R3
|
|-- function arguments
|-- return values
|-- temporary values
```

**R4-R11:**

These are usually preserved across function calls Local/saved values

**R12:**

Often called as *Intra-procedure scratch register*

Mostly temporary use by compiler.
